# Misinformation-Detection-with-GNNs
NLP701 Project - Misinformation Detection with Graph Neural Networks (Code to be Uploaded)

Social media is a popular and easily accessible source that publish news with a fast rate
of dissemination. Misinformation is the precarious product of social media that impacts
society in different negative ways. Recently, researchers have presented the repository known
as FakeNewsNet to conduct research on the detection of misinformation. This report presents
the problem formulation, motivation, dataset
structure and evaluation of machine learning
baselines on the benchmark mentioned above.
The results depict that Bernoulli Naive Bayes
achieves the highest accuracy and F1 score
among all approaches. We later explore multiple ensemble learning techniques with topK
classifiers, and BERT embedding with multiple
model designs to do the same. The graphical structure of the FakeNewsNet has already
motivated the research community to address
this task through geometric deep-learning approaches. Therefore, we explore different varients of these graphical networks to see how
graphical structure of FakeNewsNet helps in
detecting misinformation.
